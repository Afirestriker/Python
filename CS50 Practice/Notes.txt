   at line 6, it will throw an exception.

• In python the variable declared anywhere inside function is available to use in the whole funciton are it declaration.
  i.e. suppose the function has a loop, inside the loop we create a variable var.
  Now, as per the concept of 'C programming' the variable var cannot be access outside the loop, but
   in case of 'Python programming' the variable var can be access outside the loop and in the whole function
   after it has been define.

• Python does not have pointers.

• In Python, developer do not have to worry about cleaning up the memory, it is handle by python itself, as in 
  Java, JavaScript.

• In conventional way String is a colleciton of char array, but in more deeper role, the answer to this is NO.
  Since string are now more of a object.

• Pyton do not have support for increment / Decrement operator i.e. ++ / --
